        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>My name is Jackson Burgess. I was born and raised in North Vancouver and have lived there all my life. <br>
           I love computers, YouTube, and badminton; I also love to eat all day, every day. The main reason why I <br>
           took CIT is because I want to learn more about programming and to have enough skills in order to enter <br>
           the IT sector someday. Here is a <a href="resume.html">link</a> to my resume in 
           HTML form. Here is a <a href="Jackson's Resume 1.pdf">link</a> to my resume in PDF form.
